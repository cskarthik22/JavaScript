Generator is a function that can be entered and exited multiple times.
i.e it enters a function returns a value then it goes again to the same place where it has left.

Generator Functions will automatically suspend & resume their execution and stata around the last
point of value generation.
The Advantage is instead of having to compute an entire series of values up front, the generator 
computes one value waits for the next value is called for.
